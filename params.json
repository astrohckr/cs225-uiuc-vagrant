This folder will be shared with the vagrant VM, so you can edit files using the host machine. In the VM, the `data` folder is in `~/code` \r\n\r\nThis means that if this repo is located at `~/Code/cs225-uiuc-vagrant`, then you can modify/add/delete the MP and lab source code within OS X rather than the VM.\r\n\r\nThe setup script will then provision the VM to install the required software for `cs225`.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo enter a commandline prompt within the vagrant VM, run this:\r\n\r\n\tvagrant ssh\r\n\r\nYou'll then see something like this:\r\n\r\n\t[vagrant@localhost ~]$\r\n\r\nPut anything you want to access from within OS X in the `~/code` folder in the VM.\r\n\r\nTo check out the cs225 course MPs and lab materials, you can either run the following from within the VM:\r\n\r\n\t[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd ~/code && svn co https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/sp15-cs225/NETID/ cs225\r\n \r\nwhere `NETID` is your...@illinois.edu NetID.\r\n\r\nOr run this in OS X in the `data` folder: \r\n\r\n\t[me@OSX]$ cd PATH_TO_DATA_FOLDER && svn co https://subversion.ews.illinois.edu/svn/sp15-cs225/NETID/ cs225\r\n\r\nwhere `PATH_TO_DATA_FOLDER` is the path to where `data` is in OS X (e.g. `~/stuff/data`).\r\n\r\nNow you can compile your labs/MPs from within the vagrant VM and run their resulting executables through `valgrind` or `asan`.\r\n\r\nTo exit the VM, press <kbd>CTRL-D</kbd> to return to the OS X commandline.\r\n\r\nThen save the VM state:\r\n\r\n\tvagrant suspend\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
